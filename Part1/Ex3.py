#  Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form (Reverse Polish Notation). Two-argument operators: +, -, *, /, ^ (priority from the lowest to the highest), brackets ( ). Operands: only letters: a,b,...,z. Assume that there is only one RPN form (no expressions like a*b*c).
# Input

# t [the number of expressions <= 100]
# expression [length <= 400]
# [other expressions]

# Text grouped in [ ] does not appear in the input file.
# Output

# The expressions in RPN form, one per line.
